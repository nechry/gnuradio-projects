# Intercepting Airport and Aircraft Communication

Use software defined radio to intercept aircraft communication.

## Introduction

Aircraft communication utilizes AM radio signals, or amplitude modulation, due to their ability to cover extensive distances. Similar to AM radio, certain AM signals can be heard over hundreds of miles in favorable conditions. Given that aircraft often operate at considerable distances from airports, AM signals prove to be well-suited for this mode of communication.

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is responsible for allocating frequencies in the radio spectrum. Specifically, the ITU has designated the High Frequency (HF) band, spanning 3-30MHz, and the Very High Frequency (VHF) band, ranging from 118-137 MHz, for analog voice dialogue in aircraft communication. High Frequency communication facilitates intercontinental communication by utilizing the ionosphere to reflect signals.
